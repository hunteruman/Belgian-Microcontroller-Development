This folder includes the following tests:
Re-identification (following unexplained differences in TF)
Tests for Ti=0.03 and 0.3s

Neither open loop gain nor crossover frequency were optimised
These results were not used for the correlations
Their utility is to check an order of the rise time and settling time
